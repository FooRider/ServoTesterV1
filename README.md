# ServoTesterV1
Mini project based on Arduino Nano that lets user test and control RC servos.

The code uses a "library" PxButtonLib that is too small to publish online. To compile 
the arduino project, this library (contained in the PxButtonLib) must be registered 
in Arduino IDE. On Windows, this can be achieved by copying the folder into 
%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Arduino\libraries .

Warning:
This is second ever project I created with Arduino, and somewhere near 10th ever program
that I wrote in C/C++. It is very possible that this project contains errors and/or
suboptimal code.

But, it is tested and it works.
